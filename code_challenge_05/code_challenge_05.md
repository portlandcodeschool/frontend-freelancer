#Code Challenge 05
## Content + Structure

# Overview

*Here's your chance to make a website and fill it with your own content.*

Create a Wordpress site with roughly the same amount of content your MODX project had, but this time you have to come up with the content too. You will have to make a content plan, draw up wireframes, and structure and populate the site accordingly.

# Specification

Content plan
* Write out a client-readable summary of how the content will be organized, from the overall structure of the site down to the editable sections
* Visually represent this using wireframes using the method of your choosing
* Specify the reasons behind the structure of the site, showing an understanding of the high-level goals of the client

Like the previous code challenge, your site will have to include the following:

* Dynamic menus
* A list of articles
* Stand-alone pages
* Editable content

* Use a responsive theme
* Change one item in the header 
* Create a child theme
* 


## Discussion

*Background and motivation about why the specification is the way it is - references to real-world projects like this. Include reference links to useful background material here*

## Success criteria

*If there are levels of achievement, describe them here. Be explicit about the minimum acceptable level of achievement and any stretch goals.*

## Delivery instructions

*What the students must do to deliver their work. Push to a repo, presentation to the class, deployment to a server, or whatever.*


# What you will need to complete this challenge

*A bullet list of language features, concepts, or skills the student are expected to use for this code challenge. Examples include "HTML ordered and unordered lists", "The CSS box model", "Absolute positioning", "Using jQuery to handle the drag & drop functionality"*

## Code samples, snippets and pseudocode 

*snippets or pseudocode that can be used as examples, components, or as a framework for the student's solution to the challenge.*

# Step by step instructions

*Specific steps to get started and to work towards completion. Can be quite explicit when the code challenge requires new and unfamiliar behaviors. Can be high-level if the student should repeat skills they already have in a new context or for a new purpose.*

# Schedule and deadline

*When the assignment (or iterations of the assignment) is due. This is an interactive process, as described for the students below.*

It is very important that you become aware of your own velocity and  productivity. We provide practice making estimates. These code challenges are designed to be difficult, so the sooner you start, the better.

In this assignment, HOW you work is as important as WHAT you produce. In addition to the instructions above, please also perform these process instructions as soon as you get team assignments:

1. Review the code challenge with your new team. 

1. Discuss your abilities, your familiarity with the problem to be solved, and how long it has taken you to accomplish earlier challenges.

1. Discuss what has worked and what hasn't in previous teams, and agree on expectations for how you want to collaborate on this challenge.

1. Look at your calendar for the coming week and estimate how much time you can devote to classwork. There will be lab time in class, but you will need to schedule time outside of class to finish quickly.

1. Schedule work sessions with your team.

1. Estimate when your team will finish this code challenge. Be careful, it's harder than it looks. Email your instructor with this estimate within twenty four hours of getting your team assignment.

1. Your instructor will collect all the estimates and establish a "drop dead" deadline for the class, at which time we will review the current code challenge and release the next code challenge.

Can your team complete this code challenge in a week? That's desired but not required. What would it take in terms of effort to do it faster than that while giving everybody an equal opportunity to learn and create?
