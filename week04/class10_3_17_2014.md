____________________________________________________________________________


We are going to install MODx:

http://modx.com/

Move to **htdocs** so that it will be on the server

#####MODX installation instructions:

http://rtfm.modx.com/revolution/2.x/getting-started/installation/basic-installation

When you get a red error page, you have to setup.

Add setup to the end of the URL

To use the setup:

http://localhost:8888/resources/modx/modxtest/setup/index.php?s=set

Set language to English and go to the **Install Options** page

MODx needs to talk to the database.  So you need to set up a database.  MAMP already has one!


Next you have to set up a database:

http://localhost:8888/MAMP/?language=English


Go to phpMyAdmin tab to get passwords for database

For Macs:

username: root

password: root

For Windows:

username: root


Back to modx install:

add the username and password from above and click test connection

If you get a red error message, you have to create a new database at the MAMP myAdminPhp,here is the link and open it in a new tab:

http://localhost:8888/MAMP/?language=English

Call the new database modx_test and click create

Go back to modx page and add the new name of the database with the same usernamer of root and password of root.

Click the test connection

If you are successful you will have a green message.

If this does not work, try and again or ask the teachers!

Click "Create or test database" and you will get some new fields.
