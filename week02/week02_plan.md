## Assignment

0. Report your hours and progress on the assignments to Nìm and Al by Sunday night.

0. Explore the resources given below. Even if you don't understand why these are needed, at least you'll get an idea of the diversity of tools.

0. Earn the next two badges in the [Treehouse Web Design Track](http://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/web-design). These are part of the "Build a Simple Website" course. If you've already dones so, great! If you've covered this material before, just take the quizzes. Otherwise, watch the screencasts and take the quizzes. Note: We will not use "Launching the Website" at this time.
	* Creating a Website Structure
	* Styling Content

0. Do the next lesson in the [Code Academy Web Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web): "HTML Structure: Using Lists", including
	* HTML Basics II
	* Social Networking Profile

Note: These lessons are embedding all CSS language in the tags as attributes. This technique helps you associate the style with the tag. Later, we'll explore separating the style from the content as we've discussed in class. 


### Development Resources -- Getting Started

### Code Inspectors & Browser Tools
Roundup by Portland's own [Code Scouts](http://codescouts.org/)!

"You need design inspiration and find yourself wondering which fonts and color palettes your favorite websites are using. You’ve been wrestling with the Javascript for a cool interactive feature, and you’re stuck and just need to look at someone else’s code that does something similar. You’re stoked that you finished your latest web project, but when it went live you noticed that your site’s pages are loading really slowly. You are trying to work out the CSS media query breakpoints on a mobile-friendly “squishy” site so that it looks ‘just right’ no matter the screen size.

These are all common web development situations that a few years ago would’ve kept a developer up at night. Luckily for us, ‘there’s a browser (or a browser-extension) for that’. Here are some of our favorite tools for analyzing, designing, and testing right in your browsers (how cool is that!)"

###Firefox

Firefox’s “Tools > Web Developer” menu: The most full-featured set of tools, Firefox’s allow you to view and live-edit front-end code and assets and includes the only tool we know of that’s browser built-in for testing Responsive layouts (“Responsive Design View”). [Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools?).

Use with:

[Firefox Web Developer Toolbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/)

[Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/firebug/)

[Wappalyzer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/): Helps identify how a website has been built and which tools and libraries it uses (ie, CMSs, JavaScript libraries, web servers, etc)

[ColorZilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/colorzilla/): An extension that provides a host of tools for analyzing and creating CSS and other design elements

[YSlow](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yslow/): Analyzes website speed and suggests ways to improve performance

[User Agent Switcher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/): provides a menu that lets you choose which device/browser to simulate, including iOS 

###Chrome

Chrome’s “Hotdog (three horizontal lines in upper right) > Developer Tools” menu: Chrome’s tools may be the least-conveniently located, but offer all of the basic functionality that one needs to accomplish most tasks, and there are lots of useful extensions that take care of the rest. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/).

Use with:

[Web Developer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm?utm_source=Code%20Scouts&utm_campaign=281f029887-Newsletter_06_07_20136_8_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6fe7c0a699-281f029887-62930889) 

[Firebug Lite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/firebug-lite-for-google-c/bmagokdooijbeehmkpknfglimnifench?utm_source=Code%20Scouts&utm_campaign=281f029887-Newsletter_06_07_20136_8_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6fe7c0a699-281f029887-62930889)

[Clear Cache](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clear-cache/cppjkneekbjaeellbfkmgnhonkkjfpdn?utm_source=Code%20Scouts&utm_campaign=281f029887-Newsletter_06_07_20136_8_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6fe7c0a699-281f029887-62930889): If you’ve ever built a website using MAMP or WAMP (front-end development tools) or have made CSS changes to a WordPress site that don’t show, you’re probably running into a caching issue. Unfortunately, Chrome has cleverly hidden its “clear 
cache” option; this extension adds it right to the toolbar.

[Chrome Sniffer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-sniffer/homgcnaoacgigpkkljjjekpignblkeae?utm_source=Code%20Scouts&utm_campaign=281f029887-Newsletter_06_07_20136_8_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6fe7c0a699-281f029887-62930889): Though it gets easier to recognize which libraries and CMSs (Content Management Systems, like WordPress or Drupal) people are using under their sites, it’s generally not obvious from a simple site inspection. This extension will help reveal that hidden info.

[Page Speed Insights](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pagespeed-insights-by-goo/gplegfbjlmmehdoakndmohflojccocli?utm_source=Code%20Scouts&utm_campaign=281f029887-Newsletter_06_07_20136_8_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6fe7c0a699-281f029887-62930889): Answers the question, “Why is my site loading so slowly?”

[WhatFont](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en&utm_source=Code%20Scouts&utm_campaign=281f029887-Newsletter_06_07_20136_8_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6fe7c0a699-281f029887-62930889): Hover over text to see the font being used to style it 

[Palette](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/palette-for-chrome/oolpphfmdmjbojolagcbgdemojhcnlod?utm_source=Code%20Scouts&utm_campaign=281f029887-Newsletter_06_07_20136_8_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6fe7c0a699-281f029887-62930889): Displays a chart of all colors appearing in any image on a website with their HEX and RGB(A) values


###Safari

Safari Develop menu: Safari has a nice suite of tools that are easily accessible from the “Develop” menu. You have to enable this menu to make it appear by going to Safari > Preferences > Advanced, and tick the checkbox at bottom of window “Show develop menu in menubar”. [Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/navigation/).

Use with:

Most of the tools available for Chrome are also available for Safari!


###Internet Explorer

Internet Explorer Developer Tools: IE has been building their set of development tools, and now offers functionality commensurate with the other major browsers. To find out more, visit the appropriate page for [your version of IE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/aa740471).

Use with:

Tools vary by browser version.

###All browsers

[Colour Bookmark](http://wearepandr.com/labs/colour_bookmark): Will show you a palette of all colors being used on the current website. Just drag the bookmarklet to your browser’s toolbar, and click it anytime you find a site you want to analyze. Super awesome and useful. 




#CSS HIERARCHY

More Specific ALWAYS WINS

From specific to general:

1. ELEMENT STYLE
2. ID - #intro
3. CLASS - .article
4. TAG - div
5. DOCUMENT INHERITANCE
