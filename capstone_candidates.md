## Reclamation Administration

The [Reclamation Administration](http://reclamationadministration.com/) is a news and research blog on building material reuse.
It is a Wordpress.com Vigilance theme, with black background.

News and resource links are why readers visit the RA. These items should stay the primary focal point of the blog. 

I would like to add:

1. Area for a changeable news/advertising/announcement banner at the top of the page but under the Title Block: The Reclamation Administration. I would like easy access and instructions on how to change the banner. It should also be able to be just an image. I would like to have it link to other pages.

2. Newsletter feature. A feature to create and send out a newsletter that is attached to the site. A button on the front page to sign up for a newsletter. Links to the newsletter archives for people to read past newsletters.

3. The background to stay black. News items are more visually interesting if the image is large. A few larger images are better than multiple smaller ones. Scanable text with images (no images by themselves).

4. Happy to have another theme as long as it works well with the content mission - news.

5. If there is anyone out there who likes to make logos I am looking for half scull, half house as the logo. I can give more information.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

THANK YOU PORTLAND CODE SCHOOL!

## Portland Latrinalia

Background. Most people have encountered something written on a bathroom wall that made them chuckle or cringe or think.Defacing someone else's property is far from legal, but writing or drawing on bathroom walls is regularly done and the effects are regularly observed.Social scientists have investigated the phenomenon, known as latrinalia. It can be categorized into common themes including love and relationships, sex, insults/hostility, political beliefs, or humor. But why do people decide to break the law to express a sentiment? What elicits a political comment versus a sexual innuendo? What might motivate someone to respond? How are regional differences reflected?

Our society is increasingly connected through technology and online, or other text, communication. Bathroom graffiti is a last bastion of handwritten and public communication, done in a location that remains one of the most private. 

Portland is a city with a rich history of individuality and community, both of which can be on display via latrinalia. Different neighborhoods within the city have a different sense of identity and what they choose to write on the bathroom wall is one of many ways it can be on display.

##Latrinalia 

[PortlandLatrinalia.org](http://PortlandLatrinalia.org) (domain name acquired; no site developed) should be a site on which people can upload photo-documentation of the latrinalia that catches their eye and label the location. The site may include separate tabs for separate neighborhoods/areas. Visitors to the site will have the chance to see and comment on photos. The site director will write occasional posts and facilitate discussion in the comments section as applicable.

PortlandLatrinalia.org will be an inviting, entertaining, and fun site to explore a rarely discussed and unique form of expression!

## Xray.fm

We are looking to collaborate with [Oregon Music News](http://oregonmusicnews.com/). While they have some great content being produced through them, their website is in dire need of a redesign and re-implementation. With your generous offer of student web design hours, we might be able to help them with that. There are a couple of details to work out, but I think that's the direction we're looking to go in.

## Portland Public Art
My name is Julian Ansell, and I am a sculptor and educator living in North Portland. This spring, I launched Portland Public Art, and would love some help developing a website. I already have the domain ([portlandpublicart.com](http://portlandpublicart.com/) )and gotpdx.com) and just need the programming side done. I have all the content/images etc, and am the sole copyright holder of all media. Please let me know if this sounds like a fit for your students' projects. Thanks!
