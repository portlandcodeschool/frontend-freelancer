Billing for your time is not just coding but also the soft skills including scheduling, billing and communication.

Give yourself the time and space to think for everything that you need to you.  Trying to find a balance.

The same thing applies to invoices and the relationship to the client when you should be thinking about HTML5 and CSS.

Internal projects.

Code switching is a minimum charge of a half hour. A good example is switching from writing code to answering email.

A half hour to answer an email takes into the account  the broader context and takes the time it takes to understand and keep track .  The broader context is the arrows.

Every time you hit alt-tab in your computer you are doing it in your brain.

This affects all aspects of the project. These are the arrow.  The bounce between the design, construction and communication.

Real work is billable.
The best tool is the one that works for you.

A useful tool might be Trello:

It is useful for managing schedule. Boards can be arranged by project, professional or personal uses.

Do it the way that you need to do it.

Project management is way of controlling code switching. It is the responsibility of the project manager to set up the channels of communication.

It is important to establish reliable and controlled communication routines.

A useful tool is **basecamp**:

#####Aspects of the project cycle

**Analysis** -What products should we be making?

* Set expectations
* Be careful about what you show clients
* Gently train clients are how to communicate

We will be a part of Discovery.  Within Discovery, most beginners start in Research.

**Discovery** - Discover the possibility, the technology, possible solutions

Discovery is billable.  If you have to go find the answer, using your judgement and your time then it is billable.

If you are using your judgement and time then it is billable.

**Research** - Research is best when it is free.  It is like design. To roam widely, But when it solves a specific problem for a client.

Bill for nap if that is when you figured out. 

Billing backward, when you did you figure out the solution?  In the chat room or in the shower or taking a nap.

For expertise: Paying for the life before the time on clock when the experience and judgement is valued.

Research is another form of code switching where you would be free to explore.

If research is attached to a task or goal, then it can be billed.

Sometimes the client requires you to spend time on a task. Charge for it.

Does it feel like work?
When you are managing your time, Do Only What's Needed.

If you are good to yourself, you can be good to the client and the project.

Learning technique is money in the bank.  If you can research successfully, that will pay off some day.  It might mean the difference between getting the job and not getting the job.

All yourself to bill for it, if something tangible comes out of it.
