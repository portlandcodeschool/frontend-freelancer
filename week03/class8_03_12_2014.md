####Understand HTML Code Validation:
____________________________________________________________________________

For this class, we will be using:

**Unicorn**:

http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/

#####Some Useful Vocablulary:

**URI** - uniform resource identifier

**URL**- uniform resource locator

Either open a website or click the tab to upload your own file

Understanding Character sets:

**ISO** - International Standards Organization

**Charset**- Character Set

**ASCII** - American Standard Code for  Information Interchange

**Unicode** - a larger character set

**UTF** - Unicode Transformation Format

**UTF-8**-the standard for English websites in an 8-bit format


Click "Check" to check your HTML

It will read your code from top to bottom.

Some useful tips for working with code checkers:

* Fix the first error first
* Work one problem at a time
* The error might be on the line that it points to, but then it might not be
* Try to understand what the debugger is trying to say
* Slow your brain down
* Only deal with the error message
* Every word matters
* Interpret the error message, it might be ok

An integrated validator will check your HTML, CSS and Character sets

The validator will get all of the files and then check them all at once. Read what the validator is telling you.

**Re-validate after every change.**

If it passes, it will provide a hyperlink and small image badge.

####Structuring CSS Logically and Legibly:
____________________________________________________________________________


The **Google Style Guide** is very helpful:

http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml

**Red** - not recommended

**Green** - Recommended practice

The difference between presentation and structural explanations.

It is full best practices and good explanations.

Some more resources:

**Always look at the date of a post but a good article anyway:**
http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2008/05/02/improving-code-readability-with-css-styleguides/

A fun example for changing presentation just by changing CSS:
http://www.csszengarden.com/

Best practices become your tool.

JSFiddle:

http://jsfiddle.net/

To select code without being able to right click in Chrome:

**View > Developer > View Source **

or 

**View > Developer > Developer's Tools**

We are going to use the Voodoo Donuts website:

Good tool for cleaning up Dirty Markup:
**www.dirtymarkup.com**

CSS is forgiving.  Even if you use an invalid selector it will not keep your CSS from rendering.

Unknown Selector - is a selector that is not valid
Invalid Token - often brackets that are not completed correctly

Select to "**Clean**" to clean the code
Clean unminimizes the code


**Sanity** - Keeping people sane but all keep things sanitized

If the notes are not relevant then do not put it in your code.

Absolute paths vs. relatitve paths.

Clone absolute paths requiring changing of the files.

Relative paths are easier because all of the resources are placed relative to one another.

The biggest cost is spent developers trying to understand code.

Write code to be read by humans, probably even you in 6 months.

You have the responsibility of making your code readable.

**TLA**- Three Letter Acronym

####SASS- Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets:
____________________________________________________________________________

http://sass-lang.com/

A way of organizing CSS styles

Make it readable to a human first and then understandable to a computer later.

Spaces and indents are useful to humans but not computers

**SASS Guide**:

http://sass-lang.com/guide

A good example is Nesting.

In SASS, it allows a developer to infer the HTML structure by looking at the CSS.

In standard CSS, you can not tell anything about the HTML structure.

Rules and relationships can be nested in SASS.

It allows you to do it all in one place without redefining the context.

Compass uses SASS and is an open-source CSS Authoring Framework

**Compass App**:

http://compass.kkbox.com/

**Compass Framework**:

http://compass-style.org/

CSS Preprocessors are powerful tools and we will learn them at the same time that we are learning CSS.

Preprocessors allow the developer to globally change  values like colors.

**Mixin**-allows the use of quasi-variables in CSS.

Compass is a good place for mixins in SASS.

SASS variables are declared with a "$" like $radius.


####LESS
____________________________________________________________________________

http://lesscss.org/

**Less** extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions.

There is a framework called bootstrap:

http://getbootstrap.com/

A framework is a group of common patterns that can be customized on your own web page.

A good example of this in grids or scaffolding:

http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html

LESS is often used by bootstrap.

Sublime text has a SASS compiler built in.

Preprocessors will tell if you have done something wrong.


####Review
____________________________________________________________________________

**Style guides**:

* Good examples of best practices
* Presentational Class Name - "How does this present itself?"
* Semantic Class Name - "What does this name mean/do?"
* Zen garden is cool - http://www.csszengarden.com/
* Validator is that the computer can read it correctly
* Well Styled means that it is easy to read by a human

**SASS**:

* SASS -Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
* SASS uses a preprocessor to create the stylesheet which can be read by a browser
* SASS allows nesting
* SASS reduces virtual noise
* SASS has elements of a programming language
* SASS uses variables, mixins, operators like "math", inheritance makes code "DRY"
* "DRY" Code - "Do Not Repeat Yourself" - You should only write something once


#####Programming Language Basics
____________________________________________________________________________

A great resource for learning about programming languages and also javascript is:


**Javascript for Cats**:

http://jsforcats.com/

######Understanding Variables and Functions

**Variables**:

var dogSentence = "Dogs are the bane of my existence";

dogSentence is the variable. Notice the camel case.  The first letter is lowercase and the first letter of the remaining words are capitalized.

**Functions**:

A function is a set of instructions to perform a specific task.

Javascript has built in functions like "replace":

dogSentence.replace('dogs', 'those blasted dogs');

In the replace function we are passing in two "arguments".  The first part is the element that is being replaced.  The second argument is what the item should be replaced with.

A function is a set of instructions to perform a specific task.

The return value is the result of an operation/ statement.
