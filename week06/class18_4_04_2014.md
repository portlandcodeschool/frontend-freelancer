____________________________________________________________________________

Download it for free here: http://www.sequelpro.com/
Windows users can try http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/, but I have not tested it. (If that doesnâ€™t work, prepare to learn the command line!)

0. Connect to MAMP
You should use these default options (more info at the link above. password should be root). Here is the socket path:
 **/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock**

2. Select your database

3. Select all tables with shift-click

4. Select File > Export. Use the default options seen below:



You will then get a .sql file that can be easily passed back and forth according to the instructions. You can import it via SequelPro by deleting all the tables and selecting File > Import. 

Welcome to the internet.
