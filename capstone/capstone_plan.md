# Capstone Front End Project
## Purpose
* demonstrate your front end chops


## Learning objectives
When you are done, you will be able to 
* Plan and design  one or more small web sites
* Apply your front end skills as you construct the application

## Teamwork

Each individual pitches a project to the class.  

Outside firms may pitch projects to class.

During the run-up to starting, students can choose to ask other students to join their project team. The choice of team members is up to the student who pitched the project. If necessary, the instructor will make team assignments.

Projects are **strongly encouraged** to have at least two team members. Having partners greatly increases your chances of succeeding.

## Deliverables

Students are required to produce the following artifacts in a project web site and a project repository. I recommend that students use the GitHub wiki associated with their project repo to tell the story of their project.

* Elevator pitch
* Brief
* Wireframes 
* Page flow diagram
* Initial User Stories
* Tests
* Code
* Beta testing program
* Change Tracker
* Technical presentations and code walkthroughs
* Project presentation and demo

See below for details about each of these deliverables.

# Schedule

Here are the dates:

* TBD - elevator pitch is ready
* TBD - First draft of brief is ready online on repo wiki 
* TBD - initial technical review of stories, wireframes, flows
* TBD - technical review of code
* TBD - technical review, beta testing begins
* TBD - demo & presentation dress rehearsals
* TBD - Demos and Presentation, After-Party

# Deliverables Details

## Elevator pitch 

A three-sentence statement succinctly presents:

* who the customer is
* what their unmet need or goal is
* how the product meets the need

And, remember, the second two sentences don't count. :-) 

## Brief

The brief is a short (one page, maybe two) summary of your web site that includes answers to the following questions:

* What are aims of the web site ( e.g. to increase traffic, increase product awareness, generate more sales, offer e-commerce, advertise a new product or service)
* Who is the target audience? What are the demographics (e.g. children, adults, social class, income levels, location, etc.)
* How will your target audience be accessing your site – via their phones, tablets or desktops?
* What look and feel or emotional reaction should the site evoke? Identify a few sites that look like what you want your site to look like.
* Do you own the domain if needed?
* How will you promote the site?

Technical overview

* You will be hosting this on whatever hosting platform appropriate for your site.
* Will you require a CMS? Which one is appropriate
* What other services will you require? What APIs will you consume?
* What testing will you do? Unit? Integration? Acceptance? Manual? You don't need a full-blown test plan, just a sketch.
* What level of test coverage are you aiming for? 10%? 25%? How will you measure it?

Project Management

* Who is the team? What are their qualifications?
* What is the schedule? 
* What features will be available first? Which will be left for later or discarded if necessary?
* Is there a budget?

## Wireframes 
## Page flow diagram
## Initial User Stories

For all three of these topics, see the article [User Stories, Wireframes, and Page Flows](../articles/user_stories_wireframes_page_flows.md)



## Code

Use HTML5 & CSS3 for the latest Chrome Browser. You do not need to be cross-browser compatible unless it is required by your client.


## Beta testing program

All students must sign up to test and submit bug reports for other projects. Plan on devoting at least two hours of your time per project.

Project teams must provide user stories and scenarios for testers, but testers are encouraged to go outside the plan and try to break the application.

## Technical presentations and code walkthroughs

There will be weekly technical reviews and code walkthoughs for all projects. Some will include outside experts. These will be on Thursday nights.


## Project presentation and demo

At the end of the course, we will show off our completed projects to classmates, technical advisors, friends and invited guests. All project teams must have a working web site to demonstrate, a short, non-verbal (no bullet points!) marketing deck, and a completed project web site to support their presentation.

There will be checkups at all technical reviews and a dress rehearsal for these presentations.  After graduation, students will be encouraged to present their projects at a public Hack & Help session.
