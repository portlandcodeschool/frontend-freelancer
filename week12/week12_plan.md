#Week 12

##What We'll Cover This Week





Set up with git

0. How to correctly set up the website in git so that only the sections that need version control receive it. This includes Plugins, Images, Themes, Child Themes and Category/subcategory pages.  

0. How git relates to deployment.  Do you version control a live site, or is it only on the development side? 

----------

0. How to deploy WP with strong admin user and password.


0. MODX analogy - what are the  WordPress equivalents of template variables and snippets? 

How to do a carousel?




2. Where/how to place bootstrap(Nim you covered how this works with a "normal" site in class on Friday, It would be awesome to see if WordPress has any funky tweaks)

3. How to access Jquery correctly or test to see if it will conflict with the Jquery connected with the theme. (possibly how to trouble shoot if there is a conflict, or how to know when to cut the cord)

Site Components:
1. A basic site with categories and subcategories for posts. (A brief overview of the Template Hierarchy, customizing them,  and any nifty tricks you've picked up on how to work with them.  A script on a page that filters categories correctly, rather than creating a template for each cat/sub-cat would be really helpful) 
2. A static page or two that look/function extremely different than the themes templates( How to create a non conforming page...or if it is better to house it outside of WordPress)
3. Create a modal or accordion section on a category page (basically anything that shows how to access Jquery correctly within a template)
4. Any "bread and butter" plugins that you think we will run into often.
5. The logo shortcode.

Backend:
1. Create a custom input field for specific client content.  There are plugins on how to do this, but your best practice approach will help.

2. Arcy -- I think you had more thoughts on this section.

Deployment:
1. How to set up a WordPress install on a server.
2. How to import the database and WordPress customizations. (and troubleshoot common issues)



1) How to migrate a website from a local environment to the final URL -- especially in regard to the database.

2) How to select which wordpress theme to use.  Different features to look for, reputation, edibility, etc.  Is it ever worth it to use a free theme?  
3) What do you edit inside the admin, and what elements of a page do you edit outside the admin area?

4) How to edit outside the admin area.  I know we went over this in class, but I still need help.  I need to know which files to go into, how to edit the code, etc.  Maybe take some common examples of things that need to often be customized and work through it in class.

5) When is wordpress the best option.  When not.

6) Starter on how to build our own themes, especially interested in building a theme with bootstrap.

7) Awesome plugins tour.
