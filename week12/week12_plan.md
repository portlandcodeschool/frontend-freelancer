## Monday

Setup, versioning, workflow


0. [X] How to correctly set up the website in git so that only the sections that need version control receive it. This comes down to putting Child Themes in repos and using discipline in managing wordpress setup procedures.

## Wednesday

Customzing Wordpress

0. How Wordpress builds a page interactive [:30 minutes max]

0. MODX analogy - what are the WordPress equivalents of template variables and snippets? What are shortcodes?

0. Starter on how to build our own themes and customize Wordpress, especially interested in building a theme with bootstrap.

0. A static page or two that look/function extremely different than the themes templates( How to create a non conforming page...or if it is better to house it outside of WordPress)

0. Where/how to place bootstrap and other CSS/JS frameworks

0. What do you edit inside the admin, and what elements of a page do you edit outside the admin area? What you do in the admin I/F goes into the database. 

0. A basic site with categories and subcategories for posts. (A brief overview of the Template Hierarchy, customizing them,  and any nifty tricks you've picked up on how to work with them.  A script on a page that filters categories correctly, rather than creating a template for each cat/sub-cat would be really helpful)

0. How to deploy WP with strong admin user and password.
0. How to import the database and WordPress customizations. (and troubleshoot common issues)

##Overflow
