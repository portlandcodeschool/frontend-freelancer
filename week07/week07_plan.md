#What We'll Cover This Week
## Other CMSs
* Big players 
* Non-database CMSs
* Market-specific CMSs
* Site builders
	
**Concepts in this section**

* Each CMS has its own strengths and weaknesses
* Not all of them are written in PHP
* Some don't use databases
* Some run entirely in the browser
* When picking a CMS, understand the reasons behind its creation (ask, "What need does this meet?")

## Anatomy of Wordpress
**Concepts in this section**

* Where you put things and what you call them in the Wordpress file structure matters to wordpress
* What are themes, child themes, plugins, widgets

## Tech community visit 

* There are several community meetups in Portland for all aspects of web development
* Some include presentations, some are hacking sessions
* You must attend at least one of these
* Your mission - meet at least one professional web developer and report back 
* See assignments, below

## Discussion: JavaScript Functions & how to learn libraries
**Concepts in this section**

* Functions are encapsulated functionality - you don't care about how they work, just about what they do
* Functions are the main way of interacting with the user (via the browser and the document object model)
* Learning all the hundreds of functions involves several activities:
	* Searching the authoritative documentation (not just Stackoverflow)
	* Solving an increasingly broad range of problems
	* Coding, coding, coding


## Online self assessment
**Concepts in this section**

* We will send you a link to a Google form where you'll have the opportunity to check your knowledge of content management systems in general and MODX in particular. 
* Not a test - "open book" - a catalyst for discussion
* It's not auto-graded so you'll have to wait for later to see how you did.
* Due Friday at 9am

## Lightning Talks
**Concepts in this section**

In 5 minutes or less, outline your strengths in Front End Development as you identify them, how you will leverage them, and how you will address your weaknesses.

## Intro to jQuery
**Concepts in this section**

* jQuery is a JavaScript library
* Makes interacting with browsers and the DOM easier
* Has a large community of contributors & plugins that do cool stuff
* Does _not_ replace an in-depth knowledge of JavaScript
* Increases the danger of _Cargo_ _Cult_ _Code_


## Writing Sass
**Concepts in this section**
* Variables, nesting, and inheritence
* .sass vs .scss
* compiling with your code editor


##Interactive JavaScript/jQuery exercise
