####SASS (Sytnactically Awesome Style Sheets):
____________________________________________________________________________

SASS is precompiled CSS

It allows you to use variable in the CSS.  It is also good for repeating and reusability of code

#####Download Scout:

#####How to Structure of SASS Project:

http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project

Take a look at the structure:

```
stylesheets/
|
|-- modules/              # Common modules
|   |-- _all.scss         # Include to get all modules
|   |-- _utility.scss     # Module name
|   |-- _colors.scss      # Etc...
|   ...
|
|-- partials/             # Partials
|   |-- _base.sass        # imports for all mixins + global project variables
|   |-- _buttons.scss     # buttons
|   |-- _figures.scss     # figures
|   |-- _grids.scss       # grids
|   |-- _typography.scss  # typography
|   |-- _reset.scss       # reset
|   ...
|
|-- vendor/               # CSS or Sass from other projects
|   |-- _colorpicker.scss
|   |-- _jquery.ui.core.scss
|   ...
|
`-- main.scss            # primary Sass file
```



The goal is to keep things granular.  In this context, granular refers to small, easy to understand pieces rather than a large unwiedly pieces.

The second is goal is to keep thing simple and logical.

So in the files structured according to their purpose:

buttons are in **buttons.scss**

fonts are in **typography.scss**

colors are in **colors.scss**


The primary SASS file is called **main.scss**

You uses files and folders according to naming conventions so that someone unfamiliar with your project can understand what you are doing.

**How do we determine which files are going to be compiled into the final CSS?**

The files that are going to be compiled are located according to the **Primary Style Sheet** which looks like:


```
// Modules and Variables
@import "partials/base";

// Partials
@import "partials/reset";
@import "partials/typography";
@import "partials/buttons";
@import "partials/figures";
@import "partials/grids";
// ...

// Third-party
@import "vendor/colorpicker";
@import "vendor/jquery.ui.core"

```


####SASS Syntax:
Notice the dollar sign("$") cues for the SASS compiler:

```
// Use Compass ('cause it rocks!)
@import "compass";

// Font weights
$light: 100;
$regular: 400;
$bold: 600;

// Base Font
$base-font-family: sans-serif;
$base-font-weight: $regular;
$base-font-size: 13px;
$base-line-height: 1.4;

// Fixed Font
$fixed-font-family: monospace;
$fixed-font-size: 85%;
$fixed-line-height: $base-line-height;

// Headings
$header-font-weight: $bold;

@import "modules/all";

```
This example has semi-colons but it can a;sp be arranged

Notice ithout the semi-colons, **SASS is white space sensitive**.

That means the white space between lines, tabs and break lines are important and are actually cues to the compiler.

#####.sass and .scss

* **.scss** allows you to import traditional css with semi-colons and curly brackets

* **.sass** is white space sensitive


#####Clone Some Files to Play With

A useful location for test files is:

https://github.com/ddemaree/ala_sass_examples

For convenience we will refer this our ALA files.

Git clone it to a new directory.


#####Open Scout

Select the **+** in the lower left to add the files to be compiled.

0. Select an Input folder - in our case the files that we just cloned
1. Select and Output folder


#####Practice Writing SASS:

Open the ala_sass_examples in Sublime Text.

For colors in your SASS, you will have to download a package in Sublime Text.

Open **01_nested_rules.scss**

Make a change to file like:

Under **border: 1px solid #ccc;** add something new like:

**padding: 25px;**

Save it and go back to Scout and press play.

You should see a configuration output like:

```
>>> Change detected at 09:51:16 to: 01_nested_rules.scss
create 01_nested_rules.css 
create 02_media_queries.css 
create 03_variables.css 
create 04_mixins.css 
create 05_mixin_vendor_prefixes.css 
create 06_mixin_clearfix.css 
create 07_grid_calculator.css 
create 08_fluid_layout.css 
create 09_color_functions.css 

Dear developers making use of FSSM in your projects, be taking place in the new shared guard/listen project. Please let us know if you need help transitioning! ^_^b - Travis Tilley >>> Compass is polling for changes. Press Ctrl-C to Stop.

```

Notice that all the files that were created according to a **Primary Style Sheet** like the one that we discussed above.


If it works, **Congratulations!** You can write and compile SASS.

If you break it, it will tell you that you are not writing CSS.

For example go back to our previous example and break it with:

**padding: 25px;jghkjhkj**

Save it and go back to Scout.

You should get an error message like: 

```
>>> Change detected at 09:55:56 to: 01_nested_rules.scss
error 01_nested_rules.scss (Line 5: Invalid CSS after "...ckground-color:": expected pseudoclass or pseudoelement, was " #fff;")
overwrite 01_nested_rules.css 
```

SASS checks and validates your CSS. If you make a mistake, it will let you know.

#####Use SASS in Your Own Projects
In your own code, look for opportunity for turning your CSS in SASS

Here some good guidelines:

0. Look for repeated parent elements
1. Look for sections of related content
2. Look for potential variables and mix-ins
3. Think of how you organize your files and looks for ways to make them easy to understand and easy to edit.

For practice, try turning your existing CSS is into SASS.
