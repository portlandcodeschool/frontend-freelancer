When picking a CMS it is important to understand the problem that it was built to solve.  If that problem is the same one that you are trying to solve then that CMS might be a good choice for your project.

Limitations of admin is what makes developers money because we get hired to make those changes.inde

It is does have very different metaphors for core concepts of rendering a page.

####Installing WordPress:
____________________________________________________________________________

A popular CMS is WordPress.

WordPress has bundled hosted on WordPress.com. It hosts the CMS for you on the web rather than in your computer.

We will be using WordPress.org:

http://wordpress.org/

Click the Download button to begin installation



####WordPress Four Big Concepts:
____________________________________________________________________________

0.  What you call things and where you put things matter!  WordPress is looking for specific resources at specific locations with specific names.

0. WordPress has themes, child themes, plugins and widgets

0. Navigation is from the wp-admin or the dashboard

0. Customizing themes and settings without writing code.  It is important to understand what that actually does whether it is editing the database or changing the database.


####Javascript Review:
____________________________________________________________________________

http://jsfiddle.net/

Sign and create an account.

**HTML section:**

```
	<h1>output: </h1>	
	<div id= "output_area">
		&nbsp;
	</div>
	</h1>
```

**Javascript section:**

```
var output_area = document.getElementById("output_area");
var myString = "Unicorns";

output_area.innerHTML = myString;
```


**CSS section:**

```
h1 {
    color: lightgrey;
}

#output_area {
    border: 1px solid blue;
    padding: 10px;
    color: darkblue;
    font-size: 50px;
}

```


####Adding Functions:
____________________________________________________________________________


Functions are the verbs of your functions.  

**Input - Arguments**

**Process - Function Declaration**

**Output - Return Value**


Adding Functions to javascript window:


```
var output_area = document.getElementById("output_area");
var myString = "Unicorns";

output_area.innerHTML = myString;

function getExcited(aString) {
    return aString + "!!!!!!!!";
}

output_area.innerHTML = getExcited(myString);
```
####Understanding Objects:
____________________________________________________________________________


http://rachelnabors.com/javascript-for-designers/#slide-23

Objects are just collections of things which Javascript calls properties.  Objects can also do things with functions called Object Methods.

Values are separated by commas and watch for the braces around the methods.

```
var unicorn = {
    name: "Twilight Sparkle",
    color: "Purple",
    wings: true,
    getName: function () {
        return "Hi, I'm" + unicorn.name;
    }
}

output_area.innerHTML = unicorn.getName();

```


####Using "this":
____________________________________________________________________________

Replace unicorn.name with this.name.

**This** sets the context for the name property.  Since we are already in a unicorn object, **this** tells javascript to look at the current object for the name property.

```
 return "Hi, I'm" + this.name;
```
So the new Object code looks like this:

```
var unicorn = {
    name: "Twilight Sparkle",
    color: "Purple",
    wings: true,
    getName: function () {
        return "Hi, I'm" + this.name;
    }
}

output_area.innerHTML = unicorn.getName();

```

####Complete Javascript Code for JS Fiddle:
____________________________________________________________________________

```
var output_area = document.getElementById("output_area");
var myString = "Unicorns";

output_area.innerHTML = myString;

function getExcited(aString) {
    return aString + "!!!!!!!!";
}

//output_area.innerHTML = getExcited(myString);


var unicorn = {
    name: "Twilight Sparkle",
    color: "Purple",
    wings: true,
    getName: function () {
        return "Hi, I'm" + this.name;
    }
}

output_area.innerHTML = unicorn.getName();

```

The HTML and CSS did not change.
