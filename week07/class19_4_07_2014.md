####Installing WordPress:
____________________________________________________________________________

A popular CMS is WordPress.

WordPress has bundled hosted on WordPress.com. It hosts the CMS for you on the web rather than in your computer.

We will be using WordPress.org:

http://wordpress.org/

Click the Download button to begin installation



####WordPress Four Big Concepts:
____________________________________________________________________________

0.  What you call things and where you put things matter!  WordPress is looking for specific resources at specific locations with specific names.

0. WordPress has themes, child themes, plugins and widgets

0. Navigation is from the wp-admin or the dashboard

0. Customizing themes and settings without writing code.  It is important to understand what that actually does whether it is editing the database or changing the database.
