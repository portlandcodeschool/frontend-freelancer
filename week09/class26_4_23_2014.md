Have we followed through with doing the things that we said that we were going to do?

We are almost 10 weeks into our course, so it is good for us to evaluate where we are as individuals and where we are as a class.

####Website Vocabulary:
____________________________________________________________________________


**Revisiting UX and UI**

**UX** - User Experience

#####Revisiting Website Anatomy
Let's look at a these functions through the language of Bootstrap

* **Carousel** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/examples/carousel/
* **Tabs**

Here are some outdated design patterns according to **North**:

* Back Buttons
* Page Preloaders
* Social Integration
* Content Pagination
* Content Insertionals
* Auto Play Media
* Non User Triggered Actions
* Infinite Pagination
* Missing Navigational Trails
* Unexplained Merged Functionality

A more critical take on the **anti-patterns** in **North**:

**The lesson is don't just use these things uncritically**

Some Useful Anatomy terms:

* **Hero area / Jumbotron**
	* Ex. Homepage of Bootstrap - http://getbootstrap.com/
* **Static Nav Bar**
	* Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar-static-top/
* **Active State**
* **Sticky Nav Bar**
* **CTA**- Call to Action
	* Ex. http://jmdragotto.com/
* **Dropdown**
* **Image Carousel**
* **Dashboard**
	* Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/examples/dashboard/
* **Accordions**
* **Gutter** - White space between columns and that can have their own style

####jQuery UI:
____________________________________________________________________________

A great place to find some more of the common interaction patterns is:

**jQuery UI** - https://jqueryui.com/

Find the term and then find a generalized pattern that you can apply yourself.


Example:  **Modal** - Modal is a little window that pops up with more information

A live demo can be found here:

http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals

A **Modal** is a way to bring up information in a contextural way.

A good way to try these out is to cut and paste these code blocks into one of the examples that you downloaded with Bootstrap



####More Useful Bootstrap UI:
____________________________________________________________________________

* **Transitions** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#transitions
* **Modal** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals
* **Dropdown** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#dropdowns
* **Scrollspy** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy
* **Tab** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs
* **Tooltip** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips
* **Popover** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers
* **Alert** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#alerts 
* **Button** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#buttons
* **Collapse** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse
* **Carousel** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel
* **Affix** - Ex. http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#affix



####Adding Bootstrap Functionality:
____________________________________________________________________________

In order to add functionality to your site,  Bootstrap behavior is often determined by which class information is associated with which HTML attributes.


#####Bootstrap Data Attributes

http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/

Turning data attributes off:

```
$(document).off('.data-api')
```

With HTML5 we are able to save data in the HTML attributes.

Taking away that data attribute takes away the functionality

Ex. 

```
	<button type="button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal">Launch modal</button>
```


**Adding Bootstrap Plugin functionality entirely through Javascript**:

```
	$('.btn.danger').button('toggle').addClass('fat')
```

So if we were to break it down

* **$** - jQuery
* **.btn.danger** - DOM element in this case button with a class danger
* **button.('toggle)** - jQuery action toggling button state
* **addClass('fat')** - Toggle adding the class 'fat'

We know that adding and removing a Bootstrap class will change functionality or behavior.
