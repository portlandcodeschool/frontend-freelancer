### Screencasts

* [Building Websites with Bootstrap 3](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/building-websites-with-bootstrap-3) is a pretty short (1 hour) overview of using Bootstrap


### Individual Assignment

Note: DO NOT do the assignment if you haven't finished going through the screencasts. Don't try to apply knowledge without learning it first or you will just waste your time.

Sometimes it's just faster to create a simple *sketch* - a quick prototype actually built out of HTML/CSS/JS- than to spend a lot of time creating intricate Photoshop mockups.

This assignment is to create a simple sketch by leveraging Bootstrap. You should be able to extend the Bootstrap examples and use a quick plugin to accomplish what you need. Just use the default styles - don't spend any more time than necessary to get something running. The emphasis here is to *get* *something* *running*.

The site should:

* Be a single page portfolio with four sections
	* Your first static site
	* Your MODX site
	* Your Wordpress site
	* A contact form with links to your LinkedIn profile
* Each section should have the following:
	* A screenshot of the web site (but see "Extra Credit, below")
	* A short description of the key techniques and technologies you used to create the site
	* The names of the other members of the team that created the site.
* Have a fixed navigation bar menu at the top with the elements "Static", "MODX", "WordPress" and "Contact Me"
* Employ smooth scrolling to each of four sections
* Highlight in the nav bar should change based on which section is visible. (this is available in a plugin)
* Use SASS (.scss files)
* Be hosted using github pages.

See the site at [The Portland Incubator](piepdx.com) for an example web site that has these behaviors. You don't need to do anything like the image slider at the top, just notice the nav bar and the scrolling behavior.

#### For extra challenge

If you have time, create live sites that the visitor can see after the click on the screenshot.

* Host the static site in the same repo so it can be served using github pages
* Migrate your MODX site to the MODX cloud and link to it
* Migrate your Wordpress site to wordpress.com and link to it.
