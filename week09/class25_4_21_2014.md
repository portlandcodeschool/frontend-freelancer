####What Do We Mean By Design Patterns?:
____________________________________________________________________________

**Pattern **- A set of rules that one can apply to a variety of circumstances.


A good example of good design patterns is **North**:

https://github.com/Snugug/north

North is a library of patterns.

Nim discovered it in the article Outdated UX Patterns and Alternatives o n the Sideproject site:

http://sideproject.io/outdated-ux-patterns/


**Semantic Versioning**:

http://semver.org/

Find successful patterns and use them.


####North is:

```
North is a set of standards and best practices for developing modern web based properties. Included are standards and best practices for all aspects of a project, from kick off through development. North encourages an agile, content-first, approach to product development and a mobile-first, in-browser, system based approach to design and development.


```

A great overview is in the readme:

https://github.com/Snugug/north/blob/master/README.md


A good example would be for instructions in **WordPress** you would use the **WordPress Codex**.  **North** would give you a **content strategy** which is more of an overview.

For example, **North's Content Strategy** iss:

```
Content strategy is the process by which content is analyzed, sorted, constructed, and placed. Users come to a site for its content first and foremost, so it is the most important part of a site. Before any discussion of design or development, an understanding of a product owner's content is imperative in order to produce not only an effective website, but lay an effective foundation for any and all future endeavors, from apps to ads to printed material. The entirety of a finished product is determined by this initial step, from what content actually is put onto pages to what components get built to what the final site looks like.


```
**North** is a high level discussion on the the ideas, strategies and patterns behind organizing a site.  If WordPress is a tool,  North might give you a context in which a tool can be used for maximum effect.

####Patterns and Bootstrap:
____________________________________________________________________________

Let's go to Bootstrap and look at the docs, specifically templates:

http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template

This path is an example of navigating by id.

Any path with a **#** is referring to a page that is already loaded and would not require going back to the server.

So:

```
	http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template
```

**#template** is the **id** for a specific part of the **getting-started** page.

**Bootstrap** is really good about organizing and navigating pages that have already been loaded.

It is specified as a normal anchor tag with a special tag. You can navigate to any type of HTML attribute and you would navigate to just like you would just like with a URL with an anchor tag.  Here is an example with **#examples**:

```
	<a href="#examples">these examples</a>
```


####Navigation Patterns:
____________________________________________________________________________


A good example is the team at Turing:

http://turing.com/

Notice that the site scrolls for you to reinforce that there is more information that is accessible by scrolling.

**Turing** is a good example of a scrollable single page site.

####Navigation can not be separated from Content Strategy

* How will the site be developed? 
* How will it be maintained?
*  How will the site be consumed?


Always ask why did somebody make this pattern?  What problem are they trying to solve?  Is that the same problem that I am trying to solve?

* **North** helps you develop a **Content Strategy**.

* **WordPress** might be the tool to execute the strategy.

Because content and presentation are separated on the Turing site, the site can be changed from a single page site to a multi-page site very easily.

One stratgy might be:

If **Navigation** are places that you can go to, then maybe they are also **Resources**.


####Skeuomorph

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph

```
A skeuomorph /ˈskjuːəmɔrf/ is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues from structures that were necessary in the original.[1] Examples include pottery embellished with imitation rivets reminiscent of similar pots made of metal[2] and a software calendar that imitates the appearance of binding on a paper desk calendar.[3]

```
####Digital vs Analog Visual Representations


Skeuomorphs eventually become abstract.  Sometimes they represent concrete experience, sometimes they are abstract.

For example, what should be the icon for a **Save**?

Why a flopping disc?  They do not even exist anymore.  Why would we be holding on to that visual information?

####FAMFAMFAM:

http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/

Icons for use on the internet.

To the see images:

http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/previews/index_abc.png


A Rosetta for the internet in 2010.

Somebody thought these were important enough include as a reference as a guide.

####Metro and IOS 7

Both design languages move away from skeuomorphism.

This is a good article on the evolution design language:

####You are designing the way that content will be delivered.  

* Do you need to reference an outside idea to make a connection?  
* Do we need to reference an existing design pattern?


####Affordance and Usability

The thing that is easiest to do is the thing that you should do.

####UI Patterns

* Affordance
* Icons
* Instructions


####Antipatterns:

Things that are tired in UX.  These are things that are everywhere.

####New Assignment- Portfolio:
____________________________________________________________________________
* Individual
	* Turn in your own repository
	* Planning your own work
	* How will the problem be solved?
	* Make a Time Estimate
* Single Page Site
* Find closest Bootstrap
	* Example.
	* Bootstrap Plugin
* Determine the look and stop and get feedback
* Smooth Scroller?
* Single Page Navigation plugin
* Highlight changes as you scroll through the page

This is a sketch of one particular way to do a portfolio.

Contact Information is always important.

Fill out the page with photos from your previous projects and some text explaining what you have learned.

Organization is important
	* Newest first?
	* Oldest first?
	
Use **gh-pages** for hosting.

It is very easy to deploy site.


####Single Page Sites Using Bootstrap:
____________________________________________________________________________

* Treats separate regions on the page like we used to treat individual pages
* Can use same or similar CMS structure to create it
* Linking to ids
* getbootstrap.com is built with bootstrap. It is an example itself
* Look at bootstrap examples:  http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples

####Make a Single Page Scroller in Bootstrap

**Start with a new download of Bootstrap with examples or with the versions that we used last week.**

If you need the link:

https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/archive/v3.1.1.zip

Look under **examples**.

The starter template might be useful to start with:

http://getbootstrap.com/examples/starter-template/

A very rough outline/diagram of the assignment:

* **Nav element** at the top of the screen
 	* Navbar-fixed-top.css/index.html
	* http://getbootstrap.com/examples/starter-template/
* Different Sections in the page
	* Get images of the your web pages
	* To screen capture on a mac
	* Command-Shift-4, then select an area: Take a screenshot of an area and save it as a file on the desktop
	* Make a form or an email link
	* ```<a href="mailto:webmaster@example.com">Web Master</a>```
* Call to action
	* Contact information and form
* Plugin
	* Plugin's use javascript and sometimes jQuery
	* Go to **Javascript** in the top menu
 	* Select **ScrollSpy** - might be useful and here is the link:
	* http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy
	
When you are testing a system with multiple repeated elements, always test with a minimum of **3**, not 2.

Probably better to start the project in a new clean folder.
	
####If you do not know where to look make sure that you have something to look for.
