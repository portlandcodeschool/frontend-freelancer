Video conferencing
=====================================

The goal for video conferencing is to have the same quality of interaction as a face-to-face conversation.

The unfortunate reality is that it's more often like shouting through an echo-y pipe, peering at a low-res postage stamp picture of a distracted, unhappy stranger.

Video conferencing is extremely important
-------------------
Screening interviews increasingly happen online rather than in a phone call.
Remote working is the norm for freelancers

Options
-------
* Skype
* Google Hangouts
* Go To Meeting
* WebEx
* (many others)

Setting up a meeting
--------------------
* Don't expect anybody to just "answer the phone" on Skype. They are all protecting their flow just like you are.
* Pre-arrange via email, chat, SMS text, or whatever the other participant's  preferred method of communication happens to be
* Get on everybody's calendar early.
* Schedule the meeting for 15 minutes before actual business is to begin so everybody has time to set up

Good preparation tips
----------------
* Verify audio and video
* Be online early
* Set up screens and presentations
* Establish a back channel for private communication. This can be a chat channel for just the team that the client can't see.
* Mute everything before you go live.
* Have a good still shot for when your video is muted
* Wear good clothing, take a shower
* Use good lighting but not too harsh.

Good video tips
----------
* Camera at eye level, not looking up your nose.
* Focus the camera if it has physical focusing.
* Look behind the camera to where the other person would be sitting.
* Do NOT look at the other windows on the screen. That makes you look shifty - like you won't look the other people in their eyes.
* Smile. Don't frown in concentration. That makes you look unhappy, even if you aren't.
* Put a Post-It™ at the camera with the word "Smile!!" to remind you to smile confidently at the camera
* What's going on behind you? The background tells a story, too. It's better that the story is "I have books and nice art in my office" instead of "I never clean my bedroom." The best backdrop is blank. 
* Turn off your video if there are lots of participants and video gets choppy - that's a sign that you are running out of bandwidth. Fewer video streams means the remaining ones look better.
* Use your video. Move around in the frame. Be expressive.
* Did I mention smiling?


Good audio practice
-------------------
* Use a headset. No excuses. 
* A USB headset with a boom mic is best. Headphones are ok but your laptop mic will make your typing sound like noisy clacking that disturbs everybody.
* Never use speakers when you're alone. Headset.
* If you are in a group with just one laptop and have to use speakers, mute/unmute aggressively. This means, 
	* When listening, mute your microphone and unmute your speakers
	* When somebody in the group is talking, mute speakers and unmute mic.
	* It's a lot of work, so have the meeting facilitator remind everybody about audio issues and somebody in the group keep on top of it.
* If you are in a group with just one laptop, move the laptop closer to the current speaker. Laptop mics are terrible.
* Test your audio before the meeting. Use the Skype call testing service.
* Did I mention muting your microphone when you're not speaking?

Screensharing
-------------
* Zoom your browser to fill the screen
* Use big fonts
* Use your mouse to point at things. They can't see your finger pointing at things on the screen.
* Prepare your desktop before you share it. Don't waste your viewer's time sorting out your desktop.

Multi-way conversation
----------------------- 
* Not a broadcast, a set of 1-on-1 conversations
* Meeting facilitator should remind people to stop talking after they've made their point so that people have time to unmute and comment. 
* Facilitator should poll participants to make sure everybody has an opportunity to be heard.

Ending the call
---------------
* It's not a social call; it's a business meeting. Don't be abrupt but don't linger over goodbyes.
* Make sure nobody has anything to more to say. In a big meeting, the facilitator should poll each participant by name to make sure they have the opportunity to be heard one last time. Give them time to unmute their microphone.
* Thank everybody for participating, then say goodbye.
* Pause for people to say whatever they're going to say, then hang up.
