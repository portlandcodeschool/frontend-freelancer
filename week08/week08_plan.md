#What We'll Cover This Week

##Stepping back - learning about learning, working on working

## Wordpress Part II
**Concepts in this section**

* Shortcodes
* The Wordpress "Loop"
* Wordpress variables
* How to take apart and edit a theme

**Concepts in this section**

* A grid system is a set of CSS rules designed to organize a page into rows and columns
* You can use media queries to change the widths and display rules for these rows and columns to make a responsive site
* By generalizing the names and concepts to a grid, you save a lot of time using and modifying a grid system
* Many grid systems include related javascript that rely on the grid system's class names 

## Writing Sass Part II
**Concepts in this section**

* Review concepts from last week
* Look closer at Mixins and functions
* SASS lab
* Can / should you use SASS in your current code challenge?


## Planning your capstone
**We want your capstone to be as sophisticated and customized to your interests and abilities as possible. Not everyone will work with the same material, and some of you will want to use new technologies that we haven't covered yet. This is an opportunity to go deeper with technologies we have already exposed you to, like HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, etc**

## jQuery 
**Concepts in this section**

* Why jQuery exists - history and motivation
* The jQuery object - a simpler API to the JavaScript API to the DOM
* jQuery selectors
* jQuery methods

## Wordpress lab
**You should be starting Iteration 2 of CC05 by EOD Wednesday. Use this lab as an opportunity to clarify any issues you may have with installing your theme or other operational issues.**

This material may or may not fit into this week


### jQuery Interactive exercise

### UI Pattern libraries
Check out a few of these

* [User Interface Design Patterns](http://ui-patterns.com/) - nice combination of examples, annotation, and explanation
* [Yahoo Design Pattern Library](https://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/) - great documentation in the classic pattern language mode but more limited in scope
* [PatternTap](http://patterntap.com/) - a huge collection of examples without much annotation



[The Wikipedia article on pattern languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) provides a more general introduciton to the power of pattern languages.

[The website of the father of pattern languages, Christopher Alexander](http://www.patternlanguage.com/), shows how he and his community are using patterns to build better cities, towns, and buildings. 

If you want to see a copy of the book that started it all: [A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction](http://www.worldcat.org/title/pattern-language-towns-buildings-construction/oclc/3132495), talk to Al or use the given worldcat.org link to find a copy at your local library.
