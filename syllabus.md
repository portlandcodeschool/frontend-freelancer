**From Al:**
I am available for a short period of time after each class. My main office hours are every Tuesday and every Thursday from 3 PM to 6 PM in the PCS classroom. I'm also willing to meet with you by prior arrangement, either online in a Google hangout or Skype screen sharing session or in a location that we both can get to easily. My calendar is as tightly fitted as a Moroccan mosaic, however, and we may have to work a little to find a time that works for both of us.  Office hours work best.

My Code School email is azimmerman@portlandcodeschool.com. Email to this address will get a reply within 24-48 hours. My cellphone is 503-970-3645, but it only works for text or voicemail. If you text me, please prefix your text with the word "PCS". Texts or voicemail will get a reply within 4 hours.

## Not a contract

For definitive contractual agreements, see the "Portland Code School Student Enrollment Agreement" that you signed. Nothing in this syllabus is intended to supercede or replace terms agreed to in that document. Where a conflict exists, that document will apply.

Educational Expectations

## Student Time Commitment

Class hours: **Monday, Wednesday & Friday 9a - 11:50a**

Class begins promptly at 9am. Late arrivals and missing team members are very disruptive. If you are going to miss class or even be as little as 10 minutes late, please text Al at 503-970-3645 prior to 9am.

This course requires 9 hours each week for classroom time. In addition, students will have to devote approximately 10-15 outside hours of their own time each week. 
In effect, this is a second job of between 20-25 hours each week if you want to get your money's worth.

## Goal setting and deadlines

A core skill of freelance work is being able to estimate when you will complete a task. This requires being aware of your own skills and your own productivity. Unlike classes at other schools, this course will not tell you when assignments are due. Instead, it requires you to estimate completion times for all assignments, to measure both your effort and your productivity, and to learn time management techniques that work for you. 

While setting your own assignment deadlines, you will asked to cultivate a bias towards action and to complete assignments as fast as possible while maintaining a high level of quality. Like a product launch, each assignment has a "market window", after which it becomes worthless. Since most of our work is project-based teamwork, rapid completion of assignments will require learning how to motivate other members of your team as well as meeting your own commitments. This is all part of a professional skill set.


Screencasts
-----------
You all have Treehouse accounts. If you did not receive notice of your Treehouse account, please contact me. There are many alternative screencasts available for all of the topics that we will cover in this class, but we want you to invest time in the Treehouse ones. For some of you, screencasts will be a slow experience. Feel free to speed up the playback or to skip ahead to the quiz for each module to see if you already know what they are teaching. 

You are required to complete the quizzes and earn the badges. We will review your progress every two weeks to make sure you are on track.

Making screencasts a good use of your time
------------------------

Everybody has different learning styles: some people learn well through screencasts. However, realistically, the density of information is very low. Screencasts can make some subjects more accessible by having a friendly person introduce you, but there is no substitution for reading about topics on your own, studying them in depth, and then applying your knowledge by programming.

As you watch screencasts, some topics will be difficult. Some people have a natural inclination to seek out other textbooks or other screencasts when the one they are watching or reading is difficult to understand. However, this is just a delaying tactic, a form of avoidance. If you are having difficulty learning using one method of learning, the best technique is to use an entirely different method of learning. 

In our case, the best alternative when you think you don't understand how to code is to start coding. Stop the playback and try it yourself. Turn a normally passive activity, watching TV, into an active learning experience by programming while you watch.

There is no better way to learn coding then to do it, to fail, and to puzzle out what is going on. It will be a waste of time for you to switch textbooks or switch screencasts if you find that the offered resources are not giving you immediate understanding.



Interactive programming exercises.
========================
The web is full of places where you can learn to program. Again, the problem isn't finding a resource, it's completing what you set out to do. We've chosen one or two that we want you to work to completion.

Required: CodeAcademy (http://www.codecademy.com)


Computer
=========
You need to provide your own computer for this class.

Portland Code School students tend to use MacBook Pros. Most of the best coding tools are developed on that operating system first. The important aspect of OSX is the underlying UNIX-like operating system.  We place an emphasis at being able to work on a Unix/Linux command line level, down in the guts of the operating system.

A good alternative is Linux/GNU. Most of your web applications will be deployed on Linux/GNU virtual hosts in the cloud. Any Debian-based distribution will do.

Windows is at best a third alternative. While we will do our best to use cross-platform tools and techniques, you may have to discover Window alternatives on your own.

If you have a Windows laptop and you cannot manage to obtain a MacBook Pro to work with in this class, we will have a work session for creating a virtual Linux instance that you can use for class activities.  You don't need an extremely powerful laptop, but we can talk about the minimum specs if you are in this situation.

We're not saying that freelancers should demand a particular tool set. Your instructors are comfortable on any of these platforms and easily move from one to another as the client requires it. It's just makes for a more cohesive classroom experience and simpler class materials to simplify and focus on one.

Other Tools
-----------
You are required to learn and use **Sublime Text**. (http://www.sublimetext.com) The "stable" version is V2, but Al has been using V3 for a long time and it's fine. (http://www.sublimetext.com/3)  Sublime Text is not free. You can try it for free and that will get you through this class, but you should consider buying a copy when you get a job.

Now, you may already have a favorite text editor. I understand where you're coming from. However, one characteristic of professional programmers is they can walk into a shop and quickly adopt whatever toolset that company is using. Lots of programmers use Sublime Text and, if all the students in this class use it, we can learn from each other and get the most out of the tool. 

**Git** is a distributed version control system. It is complicated, arcane, and difficult to learn.  Yet, it is one of the most commonly used and essential to any freelancer. We will start using git in the first week and emphasize its use throughout. You will be required to be able to use git from the command line, but we will also explore graphical user interfaces to make your use of git more transparent and powerful.

The **Chrome Developer Tools** are a wonderful suite of browser-based tools that allow you to *see* what you are coding. There are tools like these for every major browser,  but we focus on Chrome. Front end development was stone tablets and chisels before browser-based tools.

There will be more tools introduced as the class goes on, but these are good places to start.

One type of tool we will *not* use is WYSIWYG ("What you see is what you get") development environments like Dreamweaver. By the end of this class, you will be easily and quickly coding interesting and compelling web sites "by hand."

How to succeed at this class
============================

Our ultimate goal is to be able to give a shining recommendation about you to any and all possible employers. Over the years, Al has managed and hired many software engineers at both a junior and senior level. Nìm works with shops who currently hire freelancers all the time. Our goal for you is that we would want to hire you ourselves.

Along the way, we will be asking ourselves the same questions about you that all hiring managers will be asking about you:

0. Can you work in a team?
0. Can you follow instructions and finish assignments ahead of schedule?
0. Can you extrapolate from vague inputs and take the initiative to resolve any missing information?
0. Do you have a bias towards action and taking risks?
0. Can you manage your use of your own time?
0. Can you deliver in a team context?
0. Do you have effective learning strategies?
0. Can you use testing techniques?
0. Do you write valid code?
0. Can you effectively code the front end of a modern, responsive web application?

Notice that the soft skills are at the top of the list and the programming skills are at the bottom. We will talk more about this in class.

We will check-in 1-on-1 every two weeks. You will get early notice if you need to step up your game in any particular area. After that, if in our judgment we think you still aren't able to complete the demands of the course and become a viable front end developer contractor or employee, we will discuss alternatives with you that may include termination of your contract with Portland Code School.

Don't worry: every two weeks, you also get to evaluate *us*. Fair is fair, after all. See below.


Student Effort
--------------
This class is "homework first" - with the exception of the first session, all sessions require students to prepare by watching screencasts, reading assignments, coding, testing, or otherwise performing assignments /before/ the next class so that they arrive ready and prepared to contribute to the team. You will **not** have the opportunity to catch up in class. 

Students who attend class unprepared diminish the learning opportunities for everyone, not just themselves.

Mutual Respect
--------------
This class depends upon an atmosphere of mutual respect among students and staff. Together, we create a safe place to listen, learn, speak candidly, and fail safely. This is not a typical college class, it's a team effort producing a final product: jobs for everyone. You have the opportunity to make deep connections here that you will enjoy the rest of your career. 

Students are expected to act at their highest capacity and with mutual respect for each other regardless of age, race, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, or prior experience. Instructors are expected to lead in this regard by example.

In a related vein, this class requires work in close proximity to others as we code and debug in pairs and small groups. Good hygiene is mandatory and an additional sign of respect for your colleagues.

If you experience or perceive a problem, attempt to work it out on your own, if possible, but do not hesitate to bring it privately to the attention of your instructor. If this is unsatisfactory, bring it to the attention of Cris Kelly, Portland Code School Director.

Additional Expectations
-----------------------
Each term, students may collaboratively establish other norms and expectations specific to that cohort.

<!-- 
My sticking points
  Coming to class late (even 5 min)
  Leaving class early
  screens open during lecture (I promise to keep it short)
  Not doing the prep before a session

Teaching method
===============

This course relies on the following cycle to teach each new concept:

1. Watch, listen, read, and write
1. Play & fail
1. Challenge yourself
1. Collaborate with others
1. Teach

**Watch, listen, read, and write:** Some concepts are easy, some take a little while longer to internalize. So we provide multiple modalities: screencasts, reading, conversation. We encourage note-taking both personally, by hand, and for the class as whiteboard or easel scribe

**Play and fail:** Children learn faster than adults because they play and they don't care about failing. We encourage a playful, safe learning environment. We use interactive coding tools and encourage students to try every new idea out for themselves. We encourage test-driven development, where the first step is failure (and the last step is triumph!).

**Challenge yourself:** Studies have shown that you learn the most when you have the most to lose - right after failure. For some people, it feels bad to feel stupid. For us, confusion is the first sign that we're learning and the first taste of fun times ahead.

This course teaches students how to become self-learners, how to challenge themselves to learn new skills through experimentation and trial and error. To that end, many exercises and quizzes are taken from around the web through a meticulous process to make sure the carefully curated work is relevant and high quality. The answers are all available to students if they look for them. None of these are tests in the traditional sense. If they wanted to, students could easily find, copy, and claim these answers for their own. However, this would all but guarantee that they do not acquire the skills necessary for employment. By participating in this course, students agree not to use Google, StackOverflow, or similar methods to simply find, copy, and claim answers to exercises and quizzes for their own work.


**Collaborate with others:** Employers tell us that the most important skill is working on teams. Students work together in pairs and small groups to understand problems, design solutions, and construct code. They use test-driven design to verify that their solutions work. They perform code walk-throughs to compare their work with the rest of the class. The point is to make sure that *everybody in the class* arrives at a working solution, not to find out which students are capable of finding a solution on their own and which are not.

This class puts an emphasis on participating in community. We require students to attend local community events in the beginning, then we expect them to volunteer at and eventually lead community events. Like experienced developers, we use the community as our primary means for building a business network and finding employment.

**Teach:** You don't fully understand something until you teach it to others. This class requires students to teach each other and gives them frequent practice in small, easy doses to help them become comfortable.

This also includes blogging and contributing to online forums like mailing lists and StackOverflow.com. Helping others in the community by relating what you know is an excellent way to earn a good reputation and build a personal brand. The reason this is such a wonderful time to be learning software development is because people are so willing to help each other. Students learn how to pay this forward.

Student projects
-----------------
After getting some basics under their collective belts, students will be requested to identify one or two potential projects that they can accomplish in teams of 3. These projects should provide meaning or value on a topic the students find interesting. If they can't identify a project, Portland Code School and its network of partners and employers may have several to choose from.

Students will pitch one of these projects to the PCS staff and will collaborate with staff to scale the scope so that students have a good chance of success by the end of term (including some failures along the way!).

During the final week of class, students will present their completed projects to their fellow students, staff, and members of our employer network.

## Calendar subject to change

We adjust the class each session to the needs of the current students. We may slow the pace or add additional work, as needed. We also carefully incorporate new technologies as they become significant to your employability. As a result, we often are creating class materials as we go. You will always get advance notice of classwork.

Every two weeks, you also get to evaluate *us*. We use a technique called "project retrospectives" to identify what's working for you and what we need to improve. We try to improve the course as we go.

You should all have access to a Google calendar called, "PCS" and should have received an email to this effect. If you haven't, please contact Kristina, Cris, Nìm or Al and we will make sure the class calendar is available to you. We will try to make sure this calendar is always up-to-date.
