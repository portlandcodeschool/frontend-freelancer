####Meta-Tags:
____________________________________________________________________________

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

http://www.w3schools.com/


**\<meta>** - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta

**\<meta>** tags are good for:

* **Character Sets**
* **Search Information**
 	* **SEO** (Search Engine Optimization)
 	* **Author**
 	* **Description**
 	* **Keywords**
 	
 	
Here is an example:

```
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML,CSS,XML,JavaScript">
<meta name="author" content="Hege Refsnes">
</head>

```

**The <meta> tags also let control the server**

The \<meta> tag is a like a lock on the front door of your house.  It keeps cooperative people out.


This not yet a standard but rather an emerging set of behaviors.

**pragma** - A **directive** that says this how a processor should compile its input. In our case, it is a directive for the **browser**.


Here is some other examples of the **\<meta>**:

```
	<!-- Defining the charset in HTML4 -->
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

	<!-- In HTML5 -->
	<meta charset="utf-8">

	<!-- Redirect page after 3 seconds -->
	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3;url=http://www.mozilla.org/">

```

Other tags also include metadata like:

* **\<base>**
* **\<head>**
* **\<link>**
* **\<style>**
* **\<title>**


####Micro-Architecture of a Web Page

\<tag name 	"**attributes**"	> 			\</ closing tag name>

**Attributes** - They should always be enclosed in quotes

Here is an example:

```
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```

**HTML Attributes**

* HTML elements can have attributes
* Attributes provide additional information about an element
* Attributes are always specified in the start tag
* Attributes come in name/value pairs like: name="value"


**Global Attributes**

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes

To find attributes that are unique to each tag: 

http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp

Let's look at the **\<a>** tag:

http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp

Here is an example:

```
	<a href="http://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>

```

The **\<style>** tag allows you to put **CSS** descriptions directly into the **HTML**.  Usually it is a good idea to separate **presentation** from **structure** but sometimes it is useful to include **CSS** in **HTML**.

Using a **\<style>** is called **inline** CSS.


Also if you see, **CSS** in the **HTML**, depending on the context, do not assume that it was put there by a human. Sometimes **Javascript** drops into the **HTML**.

Here is a good discussion about when **inline CSS** is a good idea:

####Third Party SASS And Bootstrap:
____________________________________________________________________________

Interacting with third party SASS libraries.

Open **Scout** or your **SASS** compiler of choice.

Make sure it has a clean version of Bootstrap SASS port.

If you need to a download a new version, here is the link:

https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/archive/v3.1.1.tar.gz

We want to be able to keep our code cleanly separated from the Bootstrap version code that will be periodically updated.

It is recommended a file tree might look like:

**Root**

* **app**
	* **sass**
	
* **public**
 	* **css**

* **custom**
 
* **vendor**


Three folders: **Bootstrap**, **Public** and **Custom**


Again the structure is to be able to upgrade **Bootstrap** without losing your **custom** code.

In our case in the **Custom** folder **_variables.scss** will override the same file in the **Bootstrap** folder.


Do **Not** Override the paths in **bootstrap.scss**

The better solution is to:

Make a new file called **sample.scss** and put it in the same folder as **bootstrap.scss**

For our example write some **SASS** without mixins in **sample.scss**

We are going to **compile** into the **public** folder.



In **Scout**:

**Input** should be the **vendor** folder

**Output** should be the **custom** folder


You might need to include the **variables** line in the **sample.scss** file to be able to make this work.

It might be like:

```
@import bootstrap/variables
```

Our **sample.scss** has a minimum number of dependencies.


In the **custom** folder make a new **bootstrap** folder and then place **_variables.scss** in it.  The idea is to make the structure of the **custom** folder to match the **bootstrap** folder.

Now,  all of the work should only be in the **custom** folder.

The idea is to change all of the paths in **bootstrap.scss** :

```
@import ../vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap
```
This way the path is referring to the current version of **Bootstrap**


A good example of why this is useful is to think about making a change to a  fundamental color in Bootstrap's default colors, say **$brand-primary**

Remember, a single **SASS** definition can make changes to hundreds of **CSS** rules.

Now your can make one change to path of **bootstrap** variables so that it looks at your **custom** folder rather than the default setting.

So change this line:

```
@import ../vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/variables
```
To:

```
@import bootstrap/variables
```
