Some good resources:

**MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)**

**W3 Schools**

**Three Parts of Any Website:**

* **Structure** - HTML
* **Presentation** - CSS
* **Behavior** - Javascript


**Meta-words vs Magic Words**

* **Meta-words** are words about structure outside of content often HTML tags
* **Magic** languages are behaviorial


**HTML** tags are semantic.  The meaning is contained in the tag.  **Semantic** descriptions are called a **meta-languange** or a **markup language**.

**Meta** is being

**Magic** is doing

It is good to remember things by taking hand notes.

Since most of Week 1 was Git here are some more notes from Week 2 that cover these ideas in more depth:

####Micro vs Macro Structure On A Page

The first thing on an HTML page is:

```
<!DOCTYPE html> 
```
**DOCTYPE** tells the browser that the next that the next text will be **HTML**

**HTML5** does not validate very well


**Element** - They are entities specifying how HTML documents should be be built like a tag

**Tag** - Text enclosed with angle brackets like **\<div>\</div>**

**Container** - An element that has an inside and it enclosed with opening and closing tags

**Elements** contain **tags** which themselves are **containers**.  While similiar, each definition is specific and different.

####Content Categories

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories

**Flow Content** - Elements belonging to the flow content category typically contain text or embedded content

**Sectioning Content** - Elements belonging to the sectioning content model create a section in the current outline that defines the scope of  **\<header>** elements, **\<footer>** elements, and heading content.


####Some Important Tags

Inside the **\<html>** body there are two elements:

* **\<head>**
* **\<body>**

Inside the **\<head> tag there is a:

* **\<title>**


**Favicon** is the little image on top of a browser image.



A typcial **HTML** format is often similar to:

```
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html>
<head>
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

**Style** tag implies **CSS**. Usually only **one** per **HTML** page.

**Link** tag could be anything that you want to import and you can have more than one.

####CSS Specificity

* **External** in the order specified
* **Internal**
* **Attribute** Style Element

Here is a good discussion on CSS specificity:

####Document Ready Event

This reason why **Javascript** is often loaded at the bottom of the page.

**jQuery** like:

```
$( document ).ready(function() { put your fun });
```

And there is a short hand like this:

```
$(function() { put your function here } );
```

Here is the **jQuery** document ready page:

http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/


These are functions.

####Javascript Functions

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function

and


http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ( ).

The parentheses may include a list of parameter names: (parameter1, parameter2, .....)

The code to be executed by the function is placed inside curly brackets: { }


The  **;** (semi-colon) is a function separator.

A useful text completion app that Nim's recommends is:

**As always, indentations, correct spacing and comments are very important!**
